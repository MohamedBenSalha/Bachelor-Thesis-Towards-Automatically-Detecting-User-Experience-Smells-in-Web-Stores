# UX Smells Classification

> Various UX smells were identified during the literature research. These can be found [here](Research/UX_Smells_Collection.md). In this data, they are to be classified and better aggregated. In addition, the relevance for web stores and the automation potential as well as the data required for this are listed in the table below.

## Categories

I based the categorization on the way the smells were grouped in [5]: GUI Bloopers 2.0: Common User Interface Design Don'ts and Dos.

- [**Visual Presentation**](#visual-presentation) |rarr; all smells related to the graphical user interface of the site web store.
- [**User Interaction**](#user-interaction) |rarr; all smells that are triggered as a result of user interaction with the web store.
- [**Lack of Transparency**](#lack-of-transparency) |rarr; all smells that screw users and do not guarantee transparency.
- [**Performance**](#performance) |rarr; any smells due to which the web store performs poorly on a technical level.
- [**Navigation**](#navigation) |rarr; all smells that make navigation in the web shop difficult and confuse the user.

## Classification

The UX Smells found [here](Research/UX_Smells_Collection.md) are grouped according to the categories mentioned above.

:loudspeaker: :warning: :rotating_light: **Automation Potential**:

```
 Since the user interaction data can be misleading, because one can only estimate to a limited extent
 and with assumptions from the user interaction which UX smell caused a bad UX, a static analysis of
 the visited pages will also take place. For this purpose, rules that deliver a good UX and whose
 absence causes a bad UX are defined and it is then checked whether they are maintained.

:loudspeaker: :warning: :rotating_light: **Aliases**:

```
Aliases are terms that are synonymous or similar in smell, in the sense in which it occurs.

| Design Unresponsiveness                    | Non-Responsive Design, No Mobile-Optimization.                      | High                     | With more and more people accessing the internet via cell phones, tablets, and all sorts of devices, a responsive website ensures that all visitors can access and use the website, giving it a significantly greater return on investment. | Medium               | - In the CSS files compare the _@media_ styles of the elements with the normal ones and see how the element styles change depending on the device size. <br> - With a WebDriver (e.g. Selenium) open the page, adjust its size to sizes of other devices, screenshot the layout and evaluate it for responsiveness.                                                                                     |
| Too Small or Close Elements                | Missing Click           | Low                      | In an online shop, the elements that stand next to each other (e.g. buttons) are usually large enough and keep a distance from each other.                                                                                                  |   Low         | - Compare the size of the buttons with its content, whether the text is too big or too small. <br> - Determine the number of juxtaposed elements (buttons, links, etc.) and then compare the total area on which they are located proportionally with their sizes and distance.                                                                                                                         |
| Overlooked Content                         | ~                                        | High                     | Products offered online cost the store owner a lot in terms of holding costs, acquisition costs, etc. If these are overlooked, then the store operator has no ROI and makes no profit.                                                      | Medium               | - Check the scrolling behavior and speed, if after the fast scrolling no specific element was clicked (footer e.g., which will otherwise explain this fast scrolling.). <br> - In the recorded visitor behavior check the number of views of a particular product page. <br> - Analysis of heat maps for the pages with many products and also the single ones to look which information is overlooked. |
| Overloaded Content                         | Overwhelming, Information Overload |        Low             | In web stores, it is normal to have many products and therefore full pages of information.                                                                                                                                                  | Low                  | - Compare the number of elements on the page with the standards. In case of violation, test the existence of filters, padding and search function. <br> - Check the web page for color compatibility. <br> - Analyze too large text font.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Road Block  | Pop-Up                                 |       Low                     |   Users expect a newsletter sign up pop-up to show up in an e-commerce website, making it not that annoying. Moreover, in most cases, websites nowadays do not require plugins to be installed by the user  |  Medium                 |  Check if pop-ups keep appearing.                      |

### User Interaction

| UX Smell                            | Aliases                             |  Relevance for Web Stores | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Automation Potential | Required Data $\backslash$ Process                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Late/No Client Validation           | No Client-Side Form Validation               | High                     | The checkout process for instance requires the user to enter data. If the client-side validation of the input is missing, then it is time-consuming and frustrating for the user. Especially if the request is sent several times without being alerted to the error.                                                        | High                 | - Check if there is a large bounce rate on the forms. In the next step, reconstruct the user behavior with a WebDriver (e.g. Selenium) and make the same entries and check the behavior of the client for validation. In addition, with an API platform (e.g. Postman) check the response to see if the request sent is a bad one. <br> - Check whether the same page with the same form appears again after clicking the _submit_ or _send_ button. |
| Erasing Information on Error        | Forms that Forget.            | High                     | This is not only relevant for webshops, but on every website. If correct entries are deleted and the user has to re-enter them unnecessarily, this causes frustration and is time-consuming. It can also happen that the user forgets the input and needlessly has to remember it.                                           | High                 | After submitting the form check if due to bad requests from the server or validation from the client the user stayed on the same page. In this case check if the fields of the form are empty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Unformatted Input                   | Free Input for Limited Values               | Medium                   | When entering the shipping data, it is best not to enter the city name, street and postal code in free text, but with auto-complete or dropdown menu. Otherwise, the user could specify invalid address, which leads to both no delivery of the product and delivery costs anyway.                                           | High                 | - Check the input fields with free text and compare them with the labels, because sometimes it makes sense (In case of instruction for delivery e.g.). <br> - Make wrong entries with a WebDriver and check if they are accepted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Inaccessibility for Disabled People |                                          | Low                      | This depends on the industry, because with certain disabilities, certain items are not suitable for the affected. Furthermore, nowadays people with disabilities have certain devices and, for example, special glasses for the visually impaired , which make websites accessible, even if they were not designed that way. | Low                  | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Fake Control Element | Unresponsive Element                            | High            | A non-functioning _purchase now_ button causes users to cancel their purchase, even if they wanted to buy. In general, the UX is badly affected, because although one wants to perform actions, one gets the feeling that the page has crashed and does not respond to their requests.                                | High                 | - Check the element that is usually clicked by users, but does not trigger any actions. That is, the user is neither redirected to another page nor does the DOM of the page change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Missing Bulk Actions            | Unnecessary Bulk Actions, Required Inefficient Actions                    | Medium                   | Performing the same action several times, especially if it becomes more frequent, is annoying and time-consuming. Most users would leave the page instead of wasting time on it as long as there is no option to perform actions on groups of elements at once.                                                              | Medium               | - Check, where list of elements (shopping cart for example) occur, whether the users performing the same action for several elements of the list consecutively. This may mean that there was no bulk action possible.|

### Lack of Transparency

| **UX Smell**                            | **Aliases**                                                 | **Relevance for Web Stores** | **Justification**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Automation Potential** | **Required Data $\backslash$ Process**                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inconsistent Terminology and/or Context | Bait and Switch, Inconsistency                                            | Medium                       | Inconsistencies can be misleading and cause users to make decisions they would not have made had there been no misunderstandings. But such a case rarely occurs, and hence the grading of relevance as a medium.                                                                                                       | Low                      | - Using NLP find out and interpret the content of the button, and then check if the color matches the content. In the next step compare with the standards and guidelines.   |
| Disguised Advertisement                 |                                                              |               Low                          | The advertisements are usually inserted on high-traffic websites, so that when the visitors click on the advertisement, they are redirected to the corresponding page or another website. In a web store, the visitors are already there, and therefore, most likely, there is no advertising within the online store. | High                     | Check for each event if a user is redirected to an external website. However, the payment (e.g. PayPal) or shipping (e.g. DHL) service providers are excluded.               |
| Hidden Cost                             | Unforeseen Expenses                                                       | High                         | If costs are incurred with every purchase, about which the user was neither informed when browsing the products nor during the payment process, this can lead to mistrust and thus to both purchase cancellations and bad recommendations, but by far also to legal problems.                                          | Medium                   | - Check the prices before and after changing the number of amounts in the shopping cart. <br> - Check price in the shopping cart and in the payment process for consistency. |
| Forced Sign Up                          | Forced Continuity, Not Updating The Price, Forced Newsletter              | Low                          | The user feels forced to do or has already done things that he probably would not have done voluntarily. It is worse when there is no or an unclear possibility of withdrawal. This gives the user the feeling of having no control and being manipulated, which makes for dissatisfaction.                            | Low                      | -                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Missing product picture and/or description |     | High                     | If an e-commerce website sells products of different types, it is important to give users detailed information about the products so that they can make a final decision to compensate for the missing in-place interaction.                | High                 | - Train machine learning model that classifies images into two classes. These are: default*image and product_image. If \_src* in _img_ tag is empty, then no image exists. Otherwise, this image will be classified by the model. <br> - Check the most dominant colors on the image, since default_images are light gray in most cases.

| No Processing Page  | Missing Feedback, Lack of Efficiency                 | High                         | Users expect prompt replies from the website when they interact with it. When response times take longer, users don't guess whether the system is processing the request or has crashed. This is serious, especially when it happens in places where it shouldn't, such as the ordering process, where users may accidentally and not intentionally perform a click twice.                     |  Low             | - Check if the same action is performed several times in a row. <br> - Check the dwell time before which the user clicked something and in which nothing was done. <br> - For each page affected with long request response times check if a waiting text appears (in the DOM) or a loading spinner pops up. |

If the website does not load fast enough, visitors will leave the page. More than 33\% of visitors leave after 4 seconds of loading time, more than 50\% after 6 seconds, and more than 83\% after 7 seconds, with the page not fully loaded.                                                                          | High                     | - If a tracking tool is used, have the page load time tracked there. <br> - Include a Javascript snippet that calculates the page load time.                                                                                                                                                                 |

Users assume that such a product does not have the store and are not satisfied. Furthermore, search is one of the most important functionalities in an online store, because users want to find the product quickly, without having to browse for it for a long time. | Low                      | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This means customers can't find the products quickly and have, in some cases, to examine the whole inventory. Furthermore, poor search makes the search more difficult.                                                                                   | Low                      | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Therefore, it is not so cumbersome.                                                                                                                                            | High                     | Check the pages the user wanted to visit (based on the clicked elements, for instance).

This leads to the supposed limited and small selection of an online store. On the other hand, this is also loss-making for the store, because numerous products are overlooked and thus the target group becomes smaller over time. | Low                      | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
