# Benchmark for the evaluation of UXSD

## Benchmark Setup

The smell instances listed in the following table have been incorporated into the test store for ten days from 27, July to 05, August 2022.  
An appeal was launched via LinkedIn, university platforms, fellow students and acquaintances to interact with the test store.

## Benchmark Results

For the benchmark, we had 114 visits from Germany distributed as follows: 94 from Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, 10 from Schleswig-Holstein, 4 from Hamburg, 4 from Sachsen-Anhalt and 2 from Hessen.
These visitors performed a total of 728 actions in the test store. These actions are divided into two categories.
